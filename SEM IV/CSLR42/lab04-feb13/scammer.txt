Origins

The name of the town, "Tiruchirapalli", originated as a tribute (thiru in Tamil means respected) to a Jain monk called "Chira".
There is also a belief that Tiruchirapalli was named after a three headed demon "Trishira" (the son of Ravana) who performed penance at the Siva temple here and obtained boons here.

There is yet another belief about the origins of the name Trichy.
Apparently the name started out as Thiru Javvandhipuram (Place of Marigold flowers; javvandhi, the Tamil name for the flower Marigold which grew (and still does) in abundance in and around this region and the word puram refers to a place of dwelling) which over time became corrupted to Trichy.

Uraiyur (also pronounced as Oraiyur) which is the Old Tiruchy has a long tradition.
